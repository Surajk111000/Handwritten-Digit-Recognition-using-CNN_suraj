# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN
This code snippet demonstrates the creation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow for classifying the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the pixel values, and a CNN model is constructed with convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers for classification. The model is compiled with appropriate settings, trained on the training data, and evaluated on the test data to compute accuracy. Predicted labels are compared with actual labels, providing insight into the model's performance. Additionally, there's an optional section calculating precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Please note that the code references a predictions array, which should be generated prior to its usage for evaluation and metrics calculation.
